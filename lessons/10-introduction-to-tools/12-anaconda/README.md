# Anaconda

Installing Python from Anaconda is very simple. Anaconda is available for Linux, macOS and Windows, and is Open Source.


## Installation of Anaconda on Windows

You can download Anaconda 4.3.1 from this link :

[https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

Following the successive steps :

## Installation of a Python package

Anaconda 4.3.1 includes an easy installation of Python (2.7 or 3.6) and updates of over 100 pre-built and tested scientific and analytic Python packages. These packages include NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, etc. Over 620 more packages are available. You can install any of them with just one command:

```bash
conda install package-name
```

Over [150 packages are automatically installed with Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs).


## Get started with IPython in the Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code.

#### Running code

#### Managing the Kernel

The notebook is capable of running code in a wide range of languages, but each notebook is associated with a single Kernel (code is run in a separate process called the Kernel). This notebook is associated with the IPython kernel, therefore runs Python code. IPython supports Python 2.7 and 3.3 or newer.

The Kernel can be interrupted or restarted. It maintains the state of the notebook's computations. You can reset this state by restarting the Kernel. This is done by clicking on a button in the toolbar above.
