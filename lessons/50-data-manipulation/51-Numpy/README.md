# NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is widely used due to the exhaustivity of the functionnalities it covers. Among other things, it contains
 - a powerful N-dimensional array object
 - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
 - efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data

NumPy library uses many dependencies developped in primitive low level languages such as C,C++ or Fortran. This particularity significantly speeds up the exexcution of all NumPy functions. This feature has to be kept in mind at all time when programming with NumPy in order to benefit from the highest power/speed of NumPy.

## Install NumPy
On Mac and Linux pre-built binary package can be installed using pip.
```
pip install numpy
```

For Windows users consider using a free Python distribution such as Anaconda.
